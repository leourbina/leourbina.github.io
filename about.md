I am geek looking to build great things. My interests range from mathematics, computer science, education and machine learning all the way to cooking, cycling, rock climbing, music and learning languages (both programming and otherwise). I joined BitSight technologies in 2011 as their first engineer, and currently work there as a tech lead.

The purpose of this blog is to serve as an outlet for programming related curiosities, and commentary about the variety of technologies that I use on a daily basis, as well as the ones that I'm interested in.
